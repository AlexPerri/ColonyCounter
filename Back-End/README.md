While we encourage you to install the back end and familiarize yourself with the application, please keep in mind that none of the collaboration features involve any modification of the back end.

2. Install virtualenv (optional)
3. Create new virtualenv using python 3.6 (optional)
4. Activate the new virtualenv (optional)
5. Install git
